<p>Over the years, I used to wrote many small pieces about open source softwares. Usually, I share them in my social media pages. Occassianly if there is a learning curve to master a tool I used to save as gists in my github account. I observed its not efficient. So, here I am about to publish them for chronological sorting and search over them in future.</p>

<p>Linux and open source softwares are heavily supported by vast forums and communities. But as a researcher and an experimentallist, few issues are specific to the particular field (or the person). So, whatever I share here will address such kind of issues.</p>

<p class="mb-5">Finally, often I try new softwares and OS'es and in the past I share them as a comment in my twitter feed of FB timeline. After a decade or something, it is really fun to revisit my own opinions. So, here to I occassionally post some review pieces and will let them to test against time! :smiley: </p>
