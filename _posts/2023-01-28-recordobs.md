## 4. Streaming

- Streaming is similar to recording. Instead of save to local file, you direct it to a server
- In your YouTube Live Dashboard, create a live broadcast and choose the option streaming service
- Now it will show a streaming key
- Copy that and open stream values (as seen in 2.1) in OBS and Paste it
- If you click streaming and view your YouTube page the screen should be seen

## 5. Simultaneously stream in FB, YouTube and 30+ social media sites

- Go to restream.io and connect your social media accounts from there
- It will show a general streaming key
- Paste it in OBS
- Now you should be able to stream on all those choose services
